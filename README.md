## ts-tile-map-example


This is a simple example project on how you can use the tile map generated by [TsMap](https://github.com/dariowouters/ts-map/tree/develop) using [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/).

Because this project is just an example it only has a max zoom of 4. High zoom levels generate a lot of files.
